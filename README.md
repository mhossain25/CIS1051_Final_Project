The biggest challenge for me was the time constraint; there was more than enough time to start the initial process of coding, but I waited until the proposal to actually start writing code. Mix in the fact that I
like to be perfect with my code and that I work 20+ hours on the weekend, getting this code to work before the 12 AM deadline just seemed impossible. It is done now!

The actual implementation of this code wasn't too difficult. It's interesting to turn a simple application
such as a DCF and create it from a few hundred lines of code. I learned a little bit more about how to plot
and use the matplotlib library and I got a lot of practice error trapping. I ended up coding all of the features
I had planned for in this project. The two things I did not accomplish was indicating which series in the DCF
was the highest or the lowest. I felt it unncessary because the user can easily see which is highest or lowest.
