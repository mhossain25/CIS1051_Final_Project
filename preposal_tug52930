# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

There are two ideas I have outside of the Tracks presented from last week.
One will be to use code to move some sort of robot around in different patterns
Based on a random number from 0-9. This includes the motor commands required
for the robot to actually move. If I had an actual robot to do this with, I'd do it.

The second idea I have involves turtles and cash flow diagrams. There are libraries
and features Python offers to do these sorts of plots with but there's likely a way
do this sort of thing with the turtle library. 
I'd like to code for:
- users to specify a planning horizon (how long the diagram should be)
- what kinds of cash flows will be introduced, like random cash flows or uniform series
- the specific values of the cash flows introduced 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

This is a Solo project.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

For Project 1:
- Have you dealt with anything like this? If so, what should I look out for when
  coding for machine programming?
- Because I don't have an actual robot, testing the code would be rather difficult. 
  Should I reconsider or find an alternative for testing?
  
For Project 2:
- Is it worth the effort to code up the graphics in Turtle?
- What scaling algorithms are there?
- This is useful in Engineering Economics but not directly related to a project in
  said class. Do I need still need my other professor's approval?
